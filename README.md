- [prcups/qt6-webengine-loongarchlinux](https://github.com/prcups/qt6-webengine-loongarchlinux/)
- various patches from linux distributions for building chromium with gcc, e.g. [Fedora](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/chromium/tree/rawhide)
- llvm 16 files are generated by running `third_party/swiftshader/third_party/llvm-16.0/scripts/update.py`
